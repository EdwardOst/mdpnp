MDPNP Camel DDS ICE Demo
===========================

This sample project combines Apache Camel for enterprise integration with RTI DDS transport for real-time integration.
The intent is to demonstrate use open architecture pluggable design principles with standards based protocols for medical integration.
It uses data formats consistent with the Integrated Clinical Environment ([ICE]) standard.
It can be driven using the sample data generated by the [MDPNP demo-app][mdpnp-demo].

Sample Modules
* PatientDemographic
* DDS Subscribers for MDPNP demo-app

Patient Demographic
-------------------
Right now it is very simple.  
It generates a sample PatientDemographic java object which it publishes to a DDS topic.
There is a DDS subscriber to the PatientDemographic topic which logs it to a corresponding file.
The PatientDemographic class is derived from the IDL used to define the DDS topic.
This use case represents information that might originate in an enterprise health record (EHR) system such as VistA which is being shared with point of care delivery medicall devices such as DocBox at the bedside.

TODO: 
* generate XSD from IDL
* compare generated XSD to hand-crafted XSD
* add RESTful interface for driving test case using XSD
* drive use case with XML over both REST, SOAP, JMS, and flat file


Apache Platform Dependencies
----------------------------

This pom depends on the demo-parent project which in turn imports a pair of apache-platform pom's for dependencyManagement.
This encapsulates and provides a single point of control for Apache dependencies.
Note that the "apache platform" just refers to the fact that the project is intended to compose multiple apache projects into a logical "platform".
It is not an Apache community project although it is apache v2 licensed as is all work in this repo.
